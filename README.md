Trading with Technical and Sentimental Analysis

I developed a comprehensive stock analysis system that integrates technical analysis with sentiment analysis from social media platforms, specifically Reddit and Twitter, to identify and recommend the top 5 stocks daily. The system is built using Python and involves several key components: data extraction via the yFinance API for historical stock data and market capitalization, data retrieval from NASDAQ's FTP server for stock symbols, and data processing with pandas for cleaning and integration. I designed a robust pipeline that automates the entire process, from collecting raw data to generating actionable stock recommendations. The sentiment analysis component scrapes and processes data from social media, providing a real-time gauge of market sentiment, which is then combined with historical data to enhance the accuracy of predictions. The systemâ€™s automation and scalability ensure it delivers timely and reliable investment insights, making it a valuable tool for both individual traders and financial institutions. This project demonstrates my ability to handle complex data processing tasks, implement algorithmic solutions, and leverage multiple data sources to drive informed decision-making in financial markets.
